Quote from Saint Hildegard of Bingen:
"Agleya is cold. A person in whom the free-smelling, which is called selega, begins to grow should eat raw agleyam and the free-smelling will disappear.
And in whom orfimae begins to grow, eat raw agleyam often and the orfimae will disappear. And whoever throws up a lot of flecma should pickle agleyam with honey and eat it often.
The flecma will decrease and that will cleanse him. But whoever has excess should crush "agleyam", strain its juice through a cloth, add wine to the juice and drink it often.
He will feel better."
