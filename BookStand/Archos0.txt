Archos and the discovery of Antillia

In the year 734 after the birth of Christ, when all Spain was overrun by the miscreants of Africa, this Island of Antillia, called also the Isle of the Seven Cities, was peopled by the Archbishop of Porto with six other bishops, and certain companions, male and female, who fled from Spain with their cattle and property. The bishops erected seven Cities on the island named Archos (Aira), Antuab, Ansalli, Ansesseli, Ansodi, Ansolli and Con. The Europeans labeled the island Antillia, though locally the island was called Archos, as its capital.
