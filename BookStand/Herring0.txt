My recipe for fiery hammerhead.

Pretty nasty broth, but it works! So pour it down like it's liquid fire!
This stuff will wake up the most tired mind and have you jumping around like a desert bunny in the vastness of the Vuran.
Get a grog ration and carefully distill its contents! Then pour in coffee and chili powder to top it off!
