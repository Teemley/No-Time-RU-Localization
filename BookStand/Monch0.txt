Monch Kamambum

Far to the south, beyond the hot sands of Ard Vuran, lie deep and mysterious damp forests. It is rumored that there can be found the ancient kingdom of Kamambum. The temperature is hot there and strange but delicious fruits can be found, shaped like a plum but with a harder shell, purple in color and with many yellowish seeds. Gobbo like creatures supposedly climb and jump from tree to tree, seldom to be seen up close. They like to throw excrement at onlookers.
