The Kamambum would adorn themselves with precious blue stones which we know to be the Ark Stones. A very same potant mineral, that King Krakus VI had ordered to be mined, in the far north, and to be put into an alloy to strengthen the swords of his elite knights. This Ark was integral during his defense and eventual complete victory against Ard Vuran. However that may be, only ruins remain of the once opulent Kindom of Kamambum. Only smaller settlements located around the ruins of the natives remain.
