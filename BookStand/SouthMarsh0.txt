May 11th AD 1255 - Southern Marshes I

...General Lothar chose to attack, his knights armed with arken swords, which glimmered in the evening sun! He rallied his army and charged with all his might against the enemy's ill-defended left flank. He did not linger long in the skirmishes, but thrust like a spear into the side of the enemy army and cut them like paper. On and on he urged his men, ever further towards the borders of Ard Vuran, in the southern marshes. He knew that if he was going to win this battle, he had to be able to divide the enemy lord and prevent Tamadur and Abdul Azeez from uniting and dealing the crushing blow.
