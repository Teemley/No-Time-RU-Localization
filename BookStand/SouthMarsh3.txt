But now his army was trapped. Numerically superior to the enemy's army but in a hopeless position. Lothar, the hero of Lechwia, had lured him into a trap. His heavy cavalry could not fight in the deep, swampy ground, and the flanks around him were occupied by Lothar's soldiers, who charged again and again, decimating his army by bow and arrow. Abdul was beaten. The war was over, and the Antillean Empire was never as great as it was at that time. The albarian hordes were repulsed in the far north and the deserts of Ard Vuran were now in the hands of King Krakus VI.
