It was the spring of AD 1254 when King Krakus VI took back the lands east of the Strôm River with his loyal field generals at the helm. The final battle was decided over the southern marshes. 1255 AD, end of the southern conquest, the war was over. After the war the monument of ban carraig was not demolished but remodeled to the likeness of King Kazimir the restorer who originally settled Lechwia. Peace was restored once more.
