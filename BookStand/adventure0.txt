Adventures I: Dark Sea

Before Lord Dun became ruler over Pine Island, he was a mere boy. His father was a well known captain during the war with the northern sea raiders.
He grew up with his aunt & uncle in exile as his dad had died until his father's old friend Redbeard pulled the boy into an adventure. 
The sea raiders were looking for the boy to get their revenge on his father's heir. During a stormy night a case ensued over sea, where both parties got
stranded on the island group of Calembost. When the young boy came to himself, he figured out that Redbeard had been captured. So he got ready to
save his mentor.
