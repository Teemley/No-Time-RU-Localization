The sorcerer was on the offensive, but slowly grew weaker and exhausted. One unprecise blow by the sorcerer and Knight Dun dodged it, the sorcerer fell into the chasm of Mount Tebron and disappeared in a white flash, the fight was over. After a long journey Knight Dun returned to the king and explained all of his adventures and the fierce battle on Meus Tebron. He told him of the island he would colonize. Together with fifty of the kings men he established Cape Dun on Pine Island, and became lord over it. He married princess Eleanor and the two lived happily ever after in their castle on Pine Island. The End.
