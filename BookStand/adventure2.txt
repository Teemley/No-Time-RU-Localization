Captain Madbeard wanted to spring across a fiery chasm to attack the young boy, who said. "It is over Madbeard, don't try it, for I am clearly on a higher ledge!", but Madbeard said: "You underestimate the power of my bearrrd!" For his beard had unknown magical powers. He jumped at the boy, but he retaliated quick and stabbed the mad pirate. With that the battle was over and the friends returned to the surface. The evil sorcerer escaped on a boat.
The princess, who is named Eleanor said her fairwell to the brave boy and, escorted by Redbeard she took the long road across Archos to the mainland.
Meanwhile after much feasting and merry making our young man was crowned as champion of the island and called Dunen, which means Southling.
