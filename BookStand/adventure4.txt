Princess Eleanor was kidnapped during an ambush as we were traveling Cape Vardos down the old North-South road. I managed to follow the attackers into the wilderness of Aquitania, where the old city laid. There in Tûr Gurzun, I found out that the evil sorcerer had hid himself in the old tower and imprisoned the princess. I am alone and with no help, I hope this pigeon arrives soon. Please come and help, yours in haste -Redbeard".
