Our young champion did not wait, immediately he went by his ship, which once belonged to the old Eduardo, and sailed across the Antillean Sea, till he
set down on a small fisher village, about 50 miles west of Cape Vardos. Then he ventured north, into the no man's land. As he tracked down Redbeard they
battled the small ruffians with cunning tricks one by one. They had freed the princess, and the sorcerer made a last stand against the two.
The sorcerer said: "You, you killed Madbeard. But there is something he wanted to tell you, before you killed him in cold blood! That is all the reason why you needed to be here. So I can tell you this. This is not the end, I will await you on Meus Tebron!". Then he disappeared in a flash.
