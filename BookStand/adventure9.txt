There was cheering, then came the mourning for the fallen knights of Lechwia. Redbeard was given the funeral of a highly honored knight in the funeral gardens of Kragóń. The king himself was present as he was a good friend of Redbeard as well as our young hero's father. 
As thanks for our hero's bravery, King Casimir V gave the young man the honorary title of Knight Dun. As our young knight remembered Eduardo's words, that he should marry princess Eleanor, he kneeled and asked for the king's daughter's hand. The king declined, as our knight would have to own land first. Then the words of Eduardo and the till now unmanned island came to mind.
