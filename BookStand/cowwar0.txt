The Cow Wars Part I

In that time there were four settlements. Cape Dun, the first to be built by Lord Dun in the 1500s, the last being Pine Lake with Edwin's Mine Enterprise in the late 18th century. AD 1842 Cape Dun and Pine Lake established a republic union with the then capital of Cape Dun. These four settlements lived in relative peace to each other for decades. Then came the war. Barley Raddish and his group of ruffians had control over Byroad during a strange plague in 1865 which would turn cows violent and mad. Barleys hunger, due to a lack of steak and a lust for more power, drove him to violence!
