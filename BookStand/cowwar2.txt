The Cow Wars Part II

The civil war lasted from 1865 to 1866, with many casualties. On October 21st of 1866 at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, Barley released a great army of crazed cows as cannon fodder during his last and most daring assault. The battle would ensue on the sands of Owen's desert. Pine Lake was under the defense of a young general named Clint of the western woods in cape dun. The ruffians let the mad herd lose, and many Pine Lakean men were trampled down. At last riding on his horse, Clint Westwood lured the mad cows away, into the higher mountains, where the cows lost him, never to be seen again.
