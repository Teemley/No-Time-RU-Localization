Глава 2: Manhofer
It has been believed for long that anti gravity was kept from the general public for decades. One of these supposed anti gravity devices was developed over years in the Manhofer Institute in Root Island, Acoria.

Supposedly head of the department, Dr. Raymond Kowalski, finally released research data on something that was called the Gravity-Field Brown engine, probably named after the Biefeld-Brown effect.

Supposedly, the simple insulation of the electrodes with dielectric material created a before untested effect on prior devices. The device was not leaking energy whilst still working.
