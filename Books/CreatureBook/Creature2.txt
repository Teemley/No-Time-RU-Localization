Birgus latro gigantis

In the 19th Century a giant skeleton of a Coconut Crab was discovered by Bernard Bean.
Estimates predate it to have lived before the ice age, though families of the local natives tell stories of the Metacoco. A monstrous crab alleged to have inhabited the old cave at modern jacks beach not longer than four hundred years ago. AD 1600 to be exact. That is north of Pine Lake. Though... why should we believe old fairy tales over the mainstream consensus.
