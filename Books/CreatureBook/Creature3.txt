Глава 4:
Giant Spiders

Only fragments from the darkest bits of old tales tell of the so called giant spiders. supposedly the first settlers spent a big deal in erradicating this pest from the island. No contemporary evidence of such a creature exists but for the many tales, like Fredich B Athors venture into the Uroruh caves in the 18th century.
All the same the stories alone give me chills...
