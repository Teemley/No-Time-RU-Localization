I wonder what my old friend is doing.
Adventuring somewhere into the boundless vastness
no doubt...

It's been a good and peaceful time as Mayor,
though I do miss his smug expressionless face sometimes.
Wish he could have seen it all. Us buddies growing old together...
Smoking cigars at the terasses of Pine City...

How beautiful it is in the morning.
