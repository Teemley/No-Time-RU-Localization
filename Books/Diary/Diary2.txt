Days go by. I hope the youth won't forget
what we've fought for to create this paradise.

Sure it may be not as I've imagined.
For one if I was to rebuild Pine Island after my ideals, 
it would have been a tad more cleaner, and greener.
Less sky scrapers, reminds me of St. Andrey...

Though I guess at least it is not literally St. Andrey.
Ueghh... There is a reason why that city is now just a green jungle.
Finally that island has found some peace and quiet.
