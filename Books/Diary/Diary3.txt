Can't believe that as high personality of Pine City
the car mechanic still gives me a bad time at the inspection.

Just because I did not use his original hover pads...

I tell you back in my day, ah those old happier times.
In some respects. Alas I am growing old, my niece came by today
she is getting married. Hope it's a good chap and not some scrap billy
from down yonder.
