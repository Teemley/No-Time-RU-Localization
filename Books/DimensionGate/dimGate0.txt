Note to self, this is a copy of some notes I made in the years, not in order...
November 12th 1995, following on the original mobile time displacement unit, which got lost April 1984 together with my old friend, I've compressed my research into the building of a stationary time unit.
Work on this stationary unit has been on my mind since before the 1984 incident. In 1983 my first thoughts on possibly testing such a device on interstellar travel surfaced.
