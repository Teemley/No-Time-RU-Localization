My favorite star constellation since childhood, has been the Ape Head Cluster. The idea was crazy, but then again so was time traveling. Given that work on the prototype Time Core had to take into account spacial drift, my first task was to start work on the space aspect of the core first.
First successful tests in regards to teleportation resumed April 14th 1983. The last system update to the 1984 PLC had an inclusion of code libraries, supposed to work with the future prototype space time gate.
Meaning that dialing the device, getting statistics from it and other useful things would have been possible via the PLC. I will note down a thorough listing of these commands later...
