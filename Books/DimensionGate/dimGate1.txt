In theory the gate would pin point a location of gravity. The point would have been calculated out of five digits composing a unique id for the destinataion.
This method proved extremely crude, as the program at that time included a value of 24, or A-X in digits, which would target any future gate in the ape head cluster. 
The only problem was, that while you could connect a wormhole to the ape head cluster, none of the 24 stars would intersect with our suns location. I however found out, that my code had a logic hole in it, which would have even allowed the prototype device to dial back home.
