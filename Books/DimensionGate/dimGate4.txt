April 12th 1984.
Who ever sent back my boxes with these strange letters, has sent me a last letter. I don't know how, but this person or thing is 
aware of my stationary unit and has claimed to have taken hold of my plans, which I haven't even made yet as of 1984.
He is calling himself MIM. That's all I know...
