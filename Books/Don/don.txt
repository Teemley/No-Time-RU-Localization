Mr. Crimson. I sincerely apologize for the slight delay in the delivery.
Our package got intercepted by that dreaded Mr. Westwood.

We shall keep the annual meeting at 0 in the morning in a few days.

Ye olde italian spaghetti will be delivered, extra spicy as you wished.

If you wish to speak in private, the password is 2canpie.
