I usually don't write diaries much... But here it goes.
My thought was to write down my philosophical theories on temporal physics and of past events.
I usually theorise on the structure of the universe and it's ultimate purpose with my friend Michael.
Though Michael does not know about my temporal experiments, back in the eighties, he seems to give me insights into
aspects of how the universe is structured in a way I have not thought of before...
These past years I've been seeking to find my old friend Paul, whom I'd ardently would want to see again.
After my prolonged experiments in temporal physics, I've created a group of friends, or allies whom I can trust.
The brother Bernd, who does the radio station was already onto me and my experiments, so he found out anyway.
