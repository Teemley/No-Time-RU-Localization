If the universe is to be predetermened, and every human being in existence was already preconceived since the beginning,
as Michael proposes, how would for instance a timeline change effect such a preconceived human being?
Michael answer came pretty quick: "No matter if it is a human person or a course of events, which has to happen, there will be
some way in which it will happen. There would always be the human soul to invent computing, and the person who invented it, would
always play some part in it. And that exact human person would always have to exist in some way somewhere in history."
This would probably also allign with the time wipe theory, which always resets events to a possible cause where the time traveler
would not be the most likely cause of it.
