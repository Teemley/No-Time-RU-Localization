A more interesting thing, that came to mind later though, is the thought of the laws of physics somehow taking into account
what human choices and subjective observers mold the universe around us. Imagine someone from the future altering the past, as long as there is still a chance
of someone or something, preventing that change, the future will not change. Like a game master waiting for everyone to have done his move on the game board, till the round draws.
Or take the quantum phenomena experiments, which almost seems to indicate that the laws of physics are aware of an intelligence observing them. 
Or might it be the other way around, almost as if an intelligence was behind it... An intelligence and primal mover,
which knows already the outcome of everything. Interguing.
