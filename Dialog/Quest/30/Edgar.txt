  (Greetings!)
  (You need help?)
  (Yes! I need aid in hunting some of these chasers... I spotted them grassing underneath the mountain, to the east. Bring Tom the bartender, 5 meat legs, that should do the job. Place it on his counter)
  (I need to defeat IGOR)
  (IGOR? Ragnar told you to fight my brother I see... His helmet is his strength, without it he is vulnerable.)
  (LET US TOAST TO HIS HEALTH!)
  (Let's make a trap)
  (AYE! Dragons are carnivorous, they really like meat I tell you. Though we might need large quantities, like at least a life supply, if you ever were to catch such an amount. Any meat really...)
  (And then?)
  (The meat will be poisoned, so it will make the dragon sick, then we attack! BUT Father Preminius warned me. Dragons are smart, it may have distrust of a random giant heep of meat waiting in front of its lair.)
  (What will we do then?)
  (Father Preminius once told me, dragons know their gold treasure to the ounce, and they will act out cruel vengance on the smallest amount stolen, even when they themselves don't have much practical use for things like gold. We will disguise the meat in form of a viking, who stole the gold...)
  (We need to steal his gold.)
  (Yeah... we will think of that part once all is set up.)
  (Ok..)
  (To sum up, i will hunt what I can regarding the meat, if you want you add to it as well, we need a life time amount of meat after all... forward it to tom, who will shape it in the form of a viking. We will need to concoct a poison, you will ask Father Preminius. Lastly, we will attack.)
  (All is ready.)
  (Good! Let us get our blessing from the priest! All man, ready?!)
  (It is sunday! We will attack on monday, talk to me tomorrow. Today we feast.)
  (There! The cave!)
  (Take this fatty!! Spit him out!)
  (He lives!)
