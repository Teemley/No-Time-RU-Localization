 (Praise be to Jesus Christ.)
 (You need help?)
 (Yes! These drunken vikings... drove our ship into the rocks, together with all the medicine. Hence we thought of settling here for the while. We'd still need someone to dive down, where the rock is. Bring it to me, if you feel up to it.)
 (Praise be to Jesus Christ. Do you have the medicine? Show it...)
 (Thank you brother!) (Speaks a blessing upon you)
 (I need poison for the dragon)
 (Poison... hmm from my research there is a particular flower of a high toxic rate, which normally grows in higher levels. I think you should search this flower somewere up the big mountain. The plant has vibrant red leaves. Good luck.)
 (Go forth, slay that beast!)
 (We will share the gold fairly. Everyone according to his deeds.)
 (Sighs)
 (What is it with him?)
 (Dragon gold, it has sat long on it. It affects Ragnar.)
 (I will to talk to him)
 (My prayers are with you. As a leader of this colony, he will need to grow.)
