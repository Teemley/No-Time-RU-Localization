AHHAAA! ... sorry you scared me.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
I am stuck! What does it look like?
How'd you get here?
Well I wanted to explore the sewers... then I encountered nice room below. This was when I heard footsteps coming from down the sewer!
Okay, so what?
Those were outlaws man! They'd roast me and eat me for breakfast!
So you were too scared?
Exactly!
How'd you survive here all that time?
You know... eating the odd scraps when sneaking around. But now I just won't move anywhere!
Let's get out of here!
If you manage to open that door I'll be more than greatful! I am not going back in there. Not even ten horses will bring me back down those corridors.
You opened the door I tried to escape through so thanks for saving my life man! Ever want a beer? Meet me at the tavern at the docks.
Hey man.
There you go man. I owe you!
