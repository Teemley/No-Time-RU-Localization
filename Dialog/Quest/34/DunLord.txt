I came as quick as possible what is going on here?!
Thank you! You did us a great favor! Please join us, let's have a feast. And put these ruffians into the holding cells!
Thank you Lord for gathering us together on this table. Bless this food, that it may be nourishment of spirit as it is of the body. Amen.
Amen!
Amen.
Yamen.
Is that so... crimson?
Yes your eyes do not deceive you. And I figured out your little game here.
Yes your eyes do not deceive you... I am alive and well. See my cook warned me ahead of your trick. I just played along.
Guards! Bind that slimy little no good snake!
I sencerely apologize for all these problems! In fact let me double down on that.
That snake crimson mentioned gold ore being prevelant in this region... I will give you this region to live in!
And I am the grandson of that young hero... who later married the princess after saving her and fighting many wars!
After the events here mentioned, Eduardo showed my grandfather this island. And he told my grandfather to build Cape Dun after he returned from the continent.
How Eduardo knew of this island or of the Princess Eleanors plight... he never found out.
He vanished in a flash at that boat shaped cave to the east of here, after giving these instructions.
