Hello there!
Clint Westwood! You are a bold one, Hue Hue Hue! ...KILL HIM!
HUE HUE HUE... Westwood, you must realise you are doomed!
Oh I don't think so...
Ahh! MY LEG MY LEEG!
I am pleased to finally meet the bane of our master.
Our master currently resides in the far future, but once we have taken hold of your friend and your stupid tin time machine on wheels, you will accompany us on a trip to meet him.
After we have reconnected to home base that is... We have not received a message from our boss in quite a time, but I am sure he will be happy to see you.
Then will we have control over all of time! HUE HUE HUE HUE HUE!
