Let's have a drink... (Pauses) This place is less cheerful than a graveyard! Barkeeper where are all the people?
Mr. Westwood honorable sir... (Lowers Voice) I wish I could talk right now, better don't ask questions (Motions Westwood to look behind him).
That's a mighty heap of treasure Mr. Westwood! Care that my boys take care of em?
Django... you sleazy stinking soaked rat of a dirty human being! 
Now that's nice of you for a change! Hand over the bags unless you want a hole in your hat too big to fix! Everything okay Westwood or do I need to write it down for you?
No, I am not OKAY. I am sick, I’m tired and I’m armed too, so be careful.
(Nods at you and whispers) When I do the action, head towards the roof and cover me.
Now hand me the loot!
(Whispers to you) Unless you can fight melee of course... (Turns his head towards Django) I guess I'll have four, five... six more inmates for the prison island is it? That makes almost 30 for this week.
(Unnerved) Give it now or I'll shoot!
I'll be easy on you guys, I will aim for your legs... Catch!
UEGH!
Get him boys!
Take em out!
(Looks at the bullies) Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't have...that's me.
Bout time this town had a new sheriff... (Looks at you) Let's have a drink.
