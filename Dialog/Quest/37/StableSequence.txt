I've come to pick up my horse. Hope its saddled and ready for the trip!
Yes Sir Westwood! Right away.
Oh... and my friend here needs a steed, remember you owe me.
Sure thing (Chuckles) He can have the black donkey right next to me. He is a good buddy as long as your friend promises to take good care of him.
(Turns to you) Get ready! Go to the south, then follow the train tracks westward, that way you will eventually get to the valley under the water fall!
(Yells) Meet you there!
