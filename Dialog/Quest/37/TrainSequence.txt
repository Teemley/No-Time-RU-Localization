HUE! The train is already on its way! It is about to pass the bridge below!
...
You will never be able to stop it in time, HUE HUE HUE!
You forget one thing General Agent, this guy here has a time machine.
Oh...
Take your donkey and ride as fast as you can. Use that device I gave you, it may enable you to out run it, you can even jump higher in order get onto the train!
Disable that train before it escapes!
I'll make sure these guys get a long sentence in isla de los tontos... Somewhere where they don't get to talk.
NOOOOOOOOoooouuuu!
