Hey!
Ah a new face! Staying here for a while or just coming through for a night?
Depends, what's your story?
The name is Fredich, I have plans for a grand enterprise on the eastern plains.
Hmm whats that?
Valuable ore, gold... copper and weird blue stuff. I will find me a wife and be my own man!
I believe you can make it!
Thanks man take care! Enjoy your stay!
