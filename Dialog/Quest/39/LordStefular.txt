Hi!
Hello young boy!
Marvin said he needed a Whiskey for the hunt?
Ah, this special mixture is a personal product of my hard work and research. It hightens senses, gives you super speed. And so on...
Intersting...
Can you head to the herb trader in the city? The herb house should be somewhere in the narrow district by the harbor. Bring me a fly agaric. I need a pinch of it for the mix.
Tell me about yourself.
I am a lord from the far of country of Waldruna, a province of Lechwia. I got robbed of my title and inheritance by an envious family member. I found my refuge here, planning my eventual return...
Good Job! Now let me quickly make that mix... Come back in an hour!
Done with the mix?
No, come back in a bit...
Yes here is the mix, give it to marvin. Good Hunting!
Can I have the recipe?
(Chuckles) I like you, youngling, alright here is the recipe for the mixture... Don't use to much of it though, one sip suffices completely! And don't tell anyone...
We hunted river rats!
Hmmhmm (mumbling) Congratulations...
We even caught a giant one!
(Mumbles) Double congratulations!
...
Let's all meet in the dining room... For breakfast... later.
