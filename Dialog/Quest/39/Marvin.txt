Hard work?
If you want you can help a bit!
That was fun!
Yeah, it helps releasing alot of... anger. So, you staying here a bit longer at house dun?
I guess, tell me more about it!
The local padres vowed to take care of the fort, after one of the dun's heirs lost all of his inharitance in a drinking game.
Oh...
Yeah. By the way I was going to hunt some river rats, they are delicious, and there's too many of them down the road. They are multiplying like rabbits!
You want to serve rodants for dinner?
Hey, where Lord Stefular comes from, it's custom to raise river rats for food!
Ok...
Speaking of whom, go to him. Tell him that I will need him to make me a special concoction for the hunt. Tell him, the usual whiskey shot!
A what?
One needs to be at top physical condition and awareness to hunt in the night! He lives up in the south west tower.
Alright!
Well hurry, the number of river rats isn't going down any time soon!
Ah great! Now that this is done, let me show you the battle plan for tonight! Follow me!
Down there, that pond will be where they come out. The river rats are especially active during the night.
Alas, I could have used the gun, Pater Stefan gave me, but it will be hard to aim in the dark...
I err, know a way...
Hmm? Even during a full moon, the hunt would be hard!
I have this invention. It can direct light.
Okay!?
But it's a secret okay? It's a new thing.
Alright?
Lemme get it.
Fine!
Hey boys, what's going on, found something INTERSTING?
No, Pater Peter. Just going over the battle plan for the hunt!
(Jokes) Pater Peter, Peter Pater (Grins).
What do you think you're doing?
Edward what are you doing here?!
I asked first. Everyone in the future knows about what you're trying to do right now.
What are they saying?
People in the 18th century had flashlight technology!?
Are they saying that, or do they know?
They, I say... That.
So no actual impact on the histories technological advancement?
No... but.
I am going on a hunt Edd, see you in the future.
(Grumbling) Hmmf.
Hmm interesting. Do you have more of these lying around I could use one.
No, this one is secret!
Alright... This will do! Meet me in the fort. We should say our farewells before the hunt and get our last blessings.
Alright see you at the fort!
Alright!
(Whispers) Good Lord please, give us a good hunt! So we can feed the padres and the guests with many river rat! Amen!
Good hunt to you two!
Thanks Pater Stefan!
(Jokes) Ey Marvin, going to another war? What do you need all that clutter for!
Hunting river rats...
(Stares at Marvin)
If they retaliate...
Meet me at the hut, find some good sticks first. Three should suffice.
Alright what now?
Have you gotten some wood? Here's how to make a campfire! After you prepared it place it here on the ground and light it!
Here you go! A campfire!
Good job buddy! I made this spear, it will aid you during the hunt... Don't lose it, trust me we'll need it. Want something to bite?
Yeah! Can't say no to that!
Here... (Puts something next to the fire) you can fry em! Let's rest a bit at the fire, before the hunt.
Here... (Puts something next to the fire) you can fry em! Let's rest a bit at the fire, till night sets, for the hunt.
I've heard it's colder at night than outside... (Swallows) Man that stuff pops like a bomb, but it will help me aim better.
Well..
Alright... I am ready, I hope you are as well... let's go down to the cliff...
(Whispers) Here have your light direction device, see any river rats, aim at them with your light.
(Whispers) Oh an keep your spear ready...
(Whispers) Ok I am loaded! Aim your light at the river rats!
(Whispers) Caught it!
Boogers missed!
Aiming...
Another one good!
Alright let's move down and face them head on! Use your spear!
Alright, that should be enough killing for one night! Good job!
Watch out!
Boogers! Quick throw me your spear! The spear! Spear!
Man... that was close, it took my axe like it was nothing!
What a big one! Could have eaten a man whole!
(Exhausted) I think I am done for tonight.
Go to Lord Stefular, tell him of the catch! It will be a great breakfast I can tell you!
What an elefant that thing is! Take this!
It caught your scent! Watch out!
Take this!
And That!
That was one mighty piece of work!
Well have a good one friend! I leave you the spear, so you have something to remember this night by.
Thanks man.
You're always welcome to stay here for as long as you wish. Now after this I think i will return to work. And the river rats will keep multiplying like a wild fire! Take care friend!
