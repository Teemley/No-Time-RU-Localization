Welcome to the TAXI GUILD, wanna sign yourself up for a job?
I'd be up for that! Yeah!
Does your car have a hoverconversion?
No...
Yes!
Well get one, without it I won't take ya! Check out Bills Garage in Pine Lake, get it done!
Well get one, without it I won't take ya! Check out Bills Garage in Pine City, get it done!
Alright! Can I have your papers please!
(Give your papers)
Hmm... (Looks at your birthdate) dude you look young as heck for that age!
Genes.
Yeah, sure. (Sighs) Let's just say that your birthdate had a typo, you will need to get new papers done. You are set to be ready, you can get your taxi equipment for the car directly from me!
What now?
You get the taxi pass and the taxi lamp from me. I guess your car has a display with an insertable chip reader. The chip in the card still uses the good old override readers. So just slide it in and your car gets turned into taxi mode!
