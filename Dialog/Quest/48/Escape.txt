The rest of our people are held on the other side of the base! We will have to unlock it first from Mîms living room!
[EXCLAMATION] Halt, I warn you on behalf of MASTER MÎM. Resistance is futile, MASTER MÎM is preparing his army for INVASION. And has left for the MAIN CORE.
Look our stuff is on that stash to the right! There is my gun!
And my car keys! ...For my crab car.
See that lever behind that robot? That is the lock for the entire base! Get it!
[WARNING] If you turn that lever, you will die.
Don't trust him, he is just here to stall us take him out!
[EXCLAMATION] BASE SECURITY LEVEL 0, UNLOCKED!
Alright that should be it!

She's not here!
Luke, I thought we would never get out of here!
Michael, where is Ms. Eleanor!
I think she was taken!
Where?!
I don't know Luke! Mîm took her, they went somewhere.
[EXCLAMATION] VOLCANIC ACTIVITY CRITICAL! BASE STRUCTURE COMPROMISED!
Luke! I we got to go!
I am not going without her!
I saw Mîm take her with him. Likely took her to his starliner!
Luke! You can't save her if we are dead!
... I hope you are right.

...
All to the elevator!

Something is about to snap!
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you!
You seem a decent fellow. I'd hate to die!
