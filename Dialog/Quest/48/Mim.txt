Welcome my young friend. I have been expecting you. I see that you have brought your friends along for the ride!
Mîm.
(Smiles) I was looking forward to completing your journey.
We are here to demand your release of our friends!
(Chuckles) Hahaha! They like it here! I am sure you will agree with me once I get to convince you.
Your trickery game is at an end! (Pause) Who are you?
Who am I? What has Edward told you about me?
(Reluctant) You were a mercenary of Crimson.
That is about right... Till I proved too smart for him. I was in fact an agent of Crimson, or I was. I left him, after he planned on killing me that is! I knew too much, about... well Edward has no doubt told you where his time machine plans came from!
We worked on it together! He invented it!
You are mistaken, I invented it! Mîm, the magnificent, The Dwarf! Mîm, the mighty wormhole digger! The time traveling, space biker!
...
That is not true, the blueprints were my doing!
What blueprints edward?
...Long time ago when I was a kid, I stumbled about the plans for the time machine by chance, or maybe not chance considering the circumstances!
You never told me.
There was no need for it... It was not a secret!
(Scoffs) Sure, Edward... sure. You see, this motley crew of Scoundrels are not friends, they are always keeping their secrets from you. You could not handle it they say, you could become dangerous they fear.
What, dangerous? What is your game?
Don't listen to him!
Mîm what is your game? World domination?
Hmmm yes my game! (Chuckles) That could sum it up, what else is there in life but to seize it, and to subvert it!
Well you are not the only maniacal villain.
You mean Crimson (Laughs) He's taken care of, or how did you think the agents retreated when they tried to raid your little workshop back in Pine Lake?
Crimson was just a pawn of his great leader!
The Great Leader (Breaks out in laughter) The great leader. My friend you are not on top of your game it would seem, for I am the great leader, I've never shown my face to Crimson, I've been playing with you all this whole time. (Pauses) Yes, at last the cogwheels in your brain start turning!
...
Crimson was no problem at all to your friends. I am your true problem. And now that the trap has sprung, and your friends are all fixed in place. My A.I. has spread all over the Ape Head Cluster, replicating, building. By the press of a button, will I launch my attack and take over the world! (Pauses) And in time you will call me master!
You are mistaken, you won't convert me this time.
Ah hem I'm just saying! I think that it is you, who are mistaken, about this.
Listen to him now!
What are you?!
Me? I am your replacement! I will take over control now! I am the voice in your head that you should have listened to!
You... you are not real!
Oh no he is! Over hundreds of years, I let my AI develop new types of technologies. This is just one of many wonders that I will soon show the world. You are surrounded give up!
What is this?
An ionized molicule processor. A computing unit made of pure plasma. Fast, powerful and very intelligent. A robot which needs no metal circuits, no hard shell to protect itself. No kinetic force can beat it ever! Yet this one here is connected to the chip, in your head!
(Try to leave conversation)
Where are you going? Agent PC, kill Edward! And bring me back my meta key!
No!
Fight it!
I am trying?!
You have to obey your master!
No... never, never... wearily, wearily I obey!
Paul... (Pauses) Paul! 
...
Kill him!
Together we will rule over the universe!
Kill him!!
NEVER! (Rip out chip)
Impossible!
... Now I am taking the wheel!
This will be your last mistake! Your funeral!
And there you go! Wreck him!
Impressive...
Most impressive. Let's see how you will deal with me!
Enough of this!
Attack!
Edward! We got company!
Keep them at bay guys we take care of Mîm!
Take my gun!
Okay! That's enough fun for now!
Hahaha! Try again! Try to hit air!
Punches do nothing! Do you really think that can hurt me?
You missed!
You disappoint me! Edward holds you in such high esteem!
Surely you can do better!
That's enough fun for today!
You and your friends, you're going no where!
