What perks can you add to my attack party!
I want you to join the attack party!
Alright captain!
On second thought, it be better if you watch this base!
If you say so...
I think there is already four people on your party, Edward told us to keep it small!
[EXPLANATION] I will hack any system instantly, you will lose no time with tech obstacles with me in your company.
I want to be there, I will come with you to save Ms. Eleanor!
If you need EMP grenades, an invention I am pretty proud of, I am your man! I take a stash with me.
I have gathered a stash of medical supplies whilst you were taking over planets! If you need healing, I will be there!
I will lead you through the labyrinth on that base. From the blueprints I can tell you it is truely huge! So don't think about me being optional, I will go either way.
I have spent the last time to train my pet capsules! Edwards inventions are truely a marvel. I will attack the base with my cococrab army!
Me... I am thankful that you saved me. But I don't know if I will be able to add much to help you win!
I have spent some time training my marksman skills! If you need a bullzeye, I am your man!
Robots are no match for my fighting skills. You will fear no death with me in your party!
I might be able to handle the robots head on, just make sure I am not shot at!
Alright I believe I have them all gathered up.
AFFIRMATIVE
[Denied] Too many men in your troop.
Lemme heal ya!
Here an emp bomb!
Sorry I am all out of emp's!
