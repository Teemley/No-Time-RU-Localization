Quick! That rascal is hiding in the store! We will corner him!
Hahahahaha! You little time travel lordling! Quite appeased with yourself?
You think you had done very well! The great leader has told me everything of your doings, and timeline shenanigans!
You'd think you could now have a nice quiet time in the country, with me out of the picture!
My plans could be wrecked but no one could touch you! Oh no! Edward would look after your affairs! Hahaha!
I will deal with you first, before taking revenge on that little dwarf for ruining everything! (Angry growl).
Fight me! But do not think that with all my goods I LOST ALL MY POWER!
Hahahaha!
UEGHHH! ... argh.
Prepare to be destroyed!
Run while you can!
Hahahaha!
How did he get here?
Crimson must have remotely unlocked the prison cells...
But that must mean Big Billy!
