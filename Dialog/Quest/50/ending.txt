Woah there! You made it! I am, err young Edward is safe! ... Mîm is gone I assume?
Don't assume, or you make an ass out of you and me!
This can't be, he died! I saw it!
Must be some younger version of Mîm!
What?
He must have seen us at the volcano and followed!
Will this ever end?!
...
...Mîm go back whence you came from, you entered through fixed wormhole. You are changing history as we speak, you are creating a Paradox! 
You will destroy...
What makes you think that was not my intention you morons! Good bye friends! (Grins).
Oh noo...
It is happening!
HAHAHAHA! Wait what is happening!
UEGHHH NooooooOOOOO000!
(Ghasps).
What happened? 
W, where did he go to?
Judgement.
(Sighs) Friend, it is over. Mîm is gone, for good!
It is done.
Sir... your helmet.
(Stiff) Thanks boy, let me just put it on. There.
Where is the detective? I saw him earlier.
He is gone kid.
(Sad).
Kid, I have a feeling you will meet him again in the future!
...(Looks up).
It ain't over, even when it.
I guess so. (Cheers a little). Time traveling and all.
...
So what now?
Take the Mach 3, we will all meet back at the safehouse! We gotta celebrate, I will bring young Edward back first meet you there!
Where am I?
It's me Ms. Eleanor, I came through time and space to rescue you.
Luke.
So you defeated both of your enemies. And come to gloat over me?
No Crimson. Mîm was also your enemy.
He was just a nuiscance.
He was your great leader, the reason you strayed from your path.
Liar. Try harder.
I am not lying Crimson. I believe there is good in you. You could have become someone else than you are.
Mîm was just pinning you against us. You could have chosen a different path.
Edward, if you allude to changing his past I thought we all came to the conclusion that it is best left untouched. You underestimate the human will. Crimson would have likely become the same human being, if any of the allusions of the Detective are to be believed.
He has crimes to answer for! As much as we will present ourselfs to the authorities!
He will, at least at some point to one authority.
... Just so you know. I am aware of your younger self back there, and apparently you did forget to hide him from me. Lucky for you that I don't want to create another paradox. I am not that dull, unlike Mîm.
(Stares) Right...
Paul... Me and company will return to the safehouse. I will return Ms. Eleanor and Luke to their corresponding time. See you in the safehouse. 
Could you escort young Edward back home for me? I am sure you are the best man to do that right now.
See you in the future in NO TIME!
Come with me Edward, just for a minute.
Lemme get you some snacks from the store.
YES! That is rad! Thanks!
Can we drive in the car?
Thanks for the ride man. 
Cool car by the way!
Indeed it is.
I am going to build something like that one day.
You will.
Will I ever see you again?
I can promise you that.
You are always welcome to visit me!
Any time Detective!
