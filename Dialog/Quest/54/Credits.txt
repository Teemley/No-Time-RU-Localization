-AC QUEST
Yes I did actually meet your uncle. I see where you got your quirky side from.
Funny...
I was there when he fell into a coma for a couple days. We all blamed his experience on a delerious dream...
... who, what ever this Accordion Man was. Apparently he wasn't just dreaming it you've seen him too.

Man I need a nice coffee, but first... donuts...

-Smith
I remember some accounts of you in the archives... 
you've become quite an accomplished smith as well.
Thanks... though that was my future self.
It's still you, perhaps a trait you could pull up in this time frame. Some time in the future...

-Taxi
I'd just love doing the job of a taxi cab.
How did you ever get perms for it? Did you fake your papers?
I was lucky...

-Mini Jobs
Pizza making is my secret hobby.
The mead making was a fine skill to learn.

There was that one time that I caught a giant big ol' fish.
Which timeline do you remember that from?

By the way, I do remember some stuff about the future.
Certain thing like the original soda perfect will be come a prized rarity by some collectors.
Good to know, might earn me a buck or two.

Can't believe that one time you actually invited my distant relations in the future into the past. So irresponsible.
Come on who got hurt from it?

What about our friends left behind in the safehouse?

Most of them went back into their corresponding time. Though most won't remember what happened if they lived past our present.
It is sad, that they won't remember, we are all seperated by the tides of time...
Perhaps I will write a great book to archive these memories. This will keep the memory of our temporal adventuers alive.

//for crimson
The least we could do for Crimson.
...

Hey you youngsters!
Henry?
I... err well. I have something for you!
Don't tell me you know who we are?
I will explain in a minute, See?

A letter from Westwood?
He figured out who my families ancestors were in his time.
And handed it down to you. Who that person would know is beyond me... See.

"To friends in the future."
"It is my dearest hope that you will have a long and happy life."
"I am writing this, just as our common friend left to return into the future."
"My hope is that Henry is also well, if he remembers me still... Your friend in time... Clint Westwood."

You guys are scaring me... why does a long dead person know my name? See?
We will tell you the whole story.

Sad we can't write Westwood back...
We might see him again... time is not a barrier. Just a temporal holdup.

...I'll go now and tell Bardey my opinion about his secret recipe after all this. Ueghh...

-GOLD TIMELINE-
SAINT ANDRE 2064
What is this place?
Guys do you here the rumbling noise beneath us?
Give me some data! Quick!
Binary is being parsed and the logs are being decoded...
Saint André, June 22 1963, midnight. New Docks.
Pine Lake, August 21st 1971 at three in the morning.
(Sighs)
What's going on?
This might be the second or third time that these events are unfolding...
What is he speaking of?
Crimson... being almost infinitely smart, was also so infinitely tricky. He knew he was losing, so he thought of a way to rig the game...
Rig the game?
This is the Temporal Displacement Unit. 
Originally devised under Manhofer and then under funding of Crimson.
We knew about Crimson, but had me and Mr. Clearman caught in a temporal suspension trap for decades. 
And now that we have him it all starts again. Crimson loaded the time travelers with the research material devised over decades into the past. To shorten the span of his research.
We had taken St. André, have Crimson in custody. But he sent back two agents of his. One of them will be proving to be too smart for me to handle. They will end up a change in our timeline, which we call the Alpha, Beta and Gamma phases.
He will actively make sure to undo all we did to stop the initial creation of the TDU in the 1980s.
1980s... that's ages ago...  
Mr. Clearman, get ready.
Let's just send the entire platoon. That will be safe.
One person is risking a temporal paradox already.
He knows what to do.
Paul... it has been an honor.
No, the honor was mine.
Talk about déjà vu...

-OMEGA TIMELINE-
PINE CITY 2064
(Laughing)
(Laughing) Oh old man Clearman, smokin his pipe like a true grandpa.
Ah Jason dear chap, can you bring us the ale?
...
Let us hope this peace will last for as long as possible.
It will survive us...
So about that book you wanted to write...
I think I'll call it...
Space Time...
That's boring.
No Time?
nah... too on the nose.
