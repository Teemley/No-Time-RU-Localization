...No, we are staying on target. They are in possesion of informations which I am interested in.
We will attack at the break of night...
(Stardled) You! Wait a minute... two of the kind?
I arrived here because of you.
You did? You have decided to join me, traveled back in time to hand me the what is rightfully mine? The time machine plans.
I destroyed them.
(Angry) You fool. Like a lamb dancing in front of the lions den, you come to me bragging to me of destroying my inheritence?
It was the only wise option left.
You came to prevent me from becoming a danger to you? Is that it? Rather burn your foes house so that he has none to left to live by?
This fight has been going on for ever...
... Agents, apprehend him we will talk about this later.

We won't do no such thing.
What?
He freed us! And you will get what you deserve!
Don't harm him!
Haven't you seen enough? About what he is capable of? He should be punished!
He has done no major harm yet!
You want to judge him based on what he has already done by this time? Fair enough, by this time we were already his zombie slaves, to be done away with as he pleases. Those sewer mutated sewer monsters were his doing. The hit jobs of people in high places.
Let me talk to him!
... Fine. Show us how you're going to outsmart that orator.

I came here so you can join us.
You are wise, and cruel. Yes, you have grown very much. You robbed me of my future, and my companions. Now you want me to become your lapdog! I doubt it! I will do no such thing!
You are free to go where ever you wish!
I go and I will trouble you no more you say? I promise I won't make you any more trouble...

Yes you are free! Go. (NG+)
Do not expect me to wish you a happy and long life. You won't have either. But that won't my doing. I merely foretell. Good bye!
We won't simply allow to leave our eyes off him.
Promise you will allow him to make things right in his own time?
Hmmmf, okay we promise.

Just do reparation to the Agents first. (End)
That's what I thought, leaving me in the bitterness of a crumblem house. To gloat over me as I crawl like a dog in front of my servants. I won't wish you a long life. You will have no such pleasure (Pulls out something).
Arrgh... uegh.
(Sighs) I... I.
...
Agents... (Contorts his face)... Sorry.
... He's dead.
... I killed him.
... It was in defending me.
He seemed sorry before the end. He tried to kill me, but he has my forgiveness. Make sure he get's a burial.
Yeah... I will leave that to Agent Moe. He still owes me one.
Why me?
Do this because you owe me one. For freeing you.

What was that?
Hey where'd Mr. Clearman go?
...
Ugh...
(Grins)
Well, that was something...
Aye, buddy.
So everything went according to plan.
I don't know... only time will tell. Am I seeing this right, you let Crimson go?
Crimson's dead. Agents shot him; he had his gun pointed at me. But he seemed sorry for everything at the end.
(Stares) May his soul find mercy... That means the future is forever changed. That means the future is truly uncertain now.
...
Remember our promise. After all, we are still escapees.
Yeah...  We will turn ourselves in. At least let me have some of that free air before it comes to it.
Good bye agents. They would find it funny, but I found them guys more than scary, at our first encounter in the sewers. They don't seem too bad after all.
...
Hmm, I need to process all this and get my mind off things.
So about Ben's Donuts, shall we?
