Nice suit.
Cool clothes dude.
Looking gangsta.
(Glances at you)
(Smirks)
Didn't know the circus was in town.
What are you playing as? Sheriff Westwood!?
Must be new fashion.
Must be some weird fan fair.
Are you going to rob me?
ARRRRR!
Sir.
Good day to you.
Have a good night sir.
How is the weather on sea, captain?
Sailing from afar?
How are the waters these days, captain?
(nods) Captain.
YEHAA!
Every city has its fair share of oddities.
Are you playing the mayor or something?
Howdy Cowboy!
(nods)
A real pirate.
Wow. What a wacko.
Monster!
I have a question. Why?
What is that suit of yours?
Are you from outer space?!
Woah, that suit is rad!
I'd not wear this around here, you may get shot for being mistaken as some alien.
