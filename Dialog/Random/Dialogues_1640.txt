You should watch out when venturing out of cape dun. (whispers) There are pirates having their camp, farther out to the north west, along the beach. They attack anyone who invades their camp without leave.
Pirates made their camp just to the north west of cape dun. I mean really don't go there. You won't be able to enter anyway without admittance.
I heard that the hunter in Cape Dun pays good.
Watch out for these weird giant birds. They may be looking funny, but they are deadly.
Did you hear of gobbos? Ape-like creatures, a dangerous kind roaming in the mountains and wilderness.
If you are looking for something and don’t know where to find it, you will in Cape Dun I've heard. This place is one of the outposts between Lechwia, Archos and the Old World. So there is a good deal of things and people venturing through.
