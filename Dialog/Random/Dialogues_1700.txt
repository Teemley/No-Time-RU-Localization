Hey pal!
Leave me alone..
There should be a blacksmith nearby. Try it there.
Stop yelling at me!
I heard that the hill was once inhabited by natives.
Do I know you?
How can I help ya?
Are you alright?
Apologies accepted.
Excuse you.
General Westwood!
What?!
Well except for those raging dragon chickens in the woods. Watch out if you catch them in a bad mood it is over.
