The second war happened just as it was fortold in fatima! What hard times we are in.
There is recently alot of turmoil at the eastern continent.
All those inventions lately. What will the future bring. Maybe flying carriages.

All these shootings lately...
Oh... Man they closed down old bardeys bar... what a shame.
