I heard back in the 1970s there was this Accordion Man whom you would not want to meet at nights in the forest!
Back in the 1950s there was the dude in ravenholly. If you happened to knock on his door...
Hi... man...
Bye!
Hey great day today isn´t it?
The church for one. It is one of the few churches that celebrate the old rite.
(uneasy) Ehr I don't know look at the calendar man...
(uneasy) Ehr I don't know look at the calendar man...
Ye wow now thanks for wasting my time.
(uneasy) alright....
Ehr ok.
Hey!

Those coco crabs give you quite a pinch watch out!
I heard the bisque place over at ravenholly is pretty good...
I've recently read about the bank robbery in the 1870s in a document in Pine Lakes archives. It's worth a read! It's what lead Westwood into defeating 20 bandits single handed if you remember the story...
I don't understand why there was the need for spending our tax payer dollars for that giant bridge connecting to root island. It makes no sense, what was Manhofer doing there all thet time? And now? It's all abandoned.
Some say the abandoned Manhofer complex on root island is haunted.
