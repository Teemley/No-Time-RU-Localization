Dear friends. We have gathered here from the four corners of this little island. 
The past years have certainly been hard, and there will be many to mourn for, and much to rebuild. We have a new emperor, that has reclaimed the throne of the white lilly!
Therefore let this be a new beginning, for a bright future.
People of Pine Lake, St.André, and the rest of Pine Island.
Mayor there is so many of us, and many more will come from St. André!
I know you are used to living in cramped towers. My friend Michael is a masterful architect. I believe whole heartedly that he will manage to make a compromise for the influx of new citizen.

St. André was a big city no doubt, but it was ugly.
Let us make something beautiful to look at!
Pine Lake might be lying in ashes, but from this let us rebuild our new city. Pine City!
Sir what about the agents? They killed Mr. Westwood!
They will receive proper justice!
Ha you think you may have won Athor! Our great leaders appearance cannot be stopped. 40 years from now this world will be ours!
Take him away!
Michael, we will have to build a defense grid against their eventual emergence.
Jason knows his way with technology we will consult together on that matter.
Good... citizens of Pine City. Let us begin anew!
(Whispers) Hey there, come to check out this historic moment no doubt?
