Too many cows! Arrgh!
I don't want to die!
Where in the world did they get all these cows from?!
Direct your fire onto the ruffians! I will lead the cows away! Cover me!
Yes sir! You heard him men!
It works! It is working guys! Attack!
(Suprised) What are you doing here?! You're not supposed to be here!
Didn't you say this island was uninhabited?
Yes it was, this is just a friend who should really be on his way now!
So this is the island you were speaking of Eduardo.
What will you name it?
I think I will name it palma insula, Palm Island.
How about abiete insulae, Pine Island?
At the moment I see alot of palms.
You will see why Pine Island is more fitting, once we travel more inland.
Where are we going?
There is a cave nearby.
Here we are. Before I say goodbye I will have to give you a few directives.
Return to Coconut bay, Redbeard will send you a letter, he will need your help.
I said you have to settle this island and become lord over it, but only after you have saved your princess!
She is in danger?
No more questions, all will be made clear in time! 
After your final confrontation with the evil sorcerer, after you married Eleanor, settle to the west of this island. There is a small cape.
Try to protect the plains you find here until someone of the family of Athor will settle it in the late 18th century.
You have to pass this information down, trust no one who tells you or your children otherwise. Even if he'd be your most trusted adviser in the future.
Alright...
Now keep my words, remember them. I will now travel back to place you won't be able to follow.
Will we meet again.
Perhaps... But if I don't show up again it means all is well.
Take care friend.
Yes take care...
Hmm, Pine Island.
